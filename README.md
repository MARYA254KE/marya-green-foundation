# 🌱 Marya Green Foundation

**Hear the Voice of Nature**

The **Marya Green Foundation** is a youth-led environmental initiative founded by myself, **Marya Chepkorir**, a passionate 14-year-old climate champion. I created this website to highlight my projects, environmental campaigns, and efforts to empower other young girls like me to promote climate action.
